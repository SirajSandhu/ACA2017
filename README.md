# ACA2017 PROJECT REPORT #

This repository contains the code completed, studied and implemented as part of the semester project under the Association of Computing Activities, IIT Kanpur in 2016-17. 

 __Phase 1. COURSERA : Machine Learning by Andrew Ng   ( https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning )__  
   
   
  Studied the following :  
  - Linear and Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent  
  - Feed Forward Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
  - Collaborative Filtering  
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent, Map Reduce and Online Learning  
  
  Contains my notes and solutions to the assignment problems along with some references I found helpful.
  
__Phase 2. LEARNING PYTHON :__  
  
  
___The Python Tutorial___ : https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/  
Learnt about basic python syntax, data structures, functions, numpy.  
      
___UDACITY Programming Foundations with Python___  
( https://in.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036 )  
Learnt about modular programming, objects and classes, libraries. Implemented Movie Database of watched movies with synopsis, YouTube trailer and my ratings on HTML file.  
      
__Phase 3. FURTHER LEARNING :__
